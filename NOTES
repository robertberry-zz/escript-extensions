This only works on recent versions of EPrints. In older versions,
PluginFactory did not wrap the evaluation of the module in 'eval', which
caused it to fail when attempting to invoke the 'new' method, breaking everything!

I attempted to provide a kludge for this by mimicing the Plugin interface but
with methods that returned nothing, but this became more and more complicated
to the point where I no longer considered it tenable to use.
